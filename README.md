# Quantum_Informatics_Summer_2025

## Notes

- Choose a Heathcare Dataset
- Apply SVC
- Apply QSVC in real quantum backend
- Inovative idea: reduce error dinamically

- What entaglement is? (Mox ineer verometer, phase, spin) (in July)
- How to visialize that in a 
- We sign up probabilities of all paths that the quantum computer can go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment
- How to do error correction for phase? What type of error correction we want to focus on?
- Crigenic NVisa quantum Computers in a room temperature (the least termoenegy the better)
- What can the fundaments (equations, algorithm) that will impact my phisical system
- The student's guide to schorigan equation
