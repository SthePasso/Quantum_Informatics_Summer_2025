# Quantum_Informatics_Summer_2025

## Notes

- Choose a Heathcare Dataset
- Apply SVC
- Apply QSVC in real quantum backend
- Inovative idea: reduce error dinamically

- What entaglement is? (Mox ineer verometer, phase, spin) (in July)
- How to visialize that in a 
- We sign up probabilities of all paths that the quantum computer can go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment
- How to do error correction for phase? What type of error correction we want to focus on?

## Classical Algorithms to Learn:

- Grovers Algorithm
